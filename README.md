Unsupervised Machine Learning
A collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms and clustering techniques.

Notebooks Included
DBSCAN.ipynb

Visual and code implementation of DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).

Explains core, border, and noise points, with practical clustering examples.

Hiererichal.ipynb

Implementation and visualization of hierarchical clustering algorithms.

Shows dendrogram plots and agglomerative clustering steps.

K_means_clusturing.ipynb

Intuitive hands-on guide to K-means clustering.

Includes elbow method, initial centroids, cluster assignment, and iterations.

How to Use
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Zaidzayn/Unsupervised_MachineLearning.git
cd Unsupervised_MachineLearning
Install requirements (if any, depending on code imports inside notebooks):

text
pip install -r requirements.txt
(You may have to check notebook cells and install libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.)

Open the notebooks in Jupyter:

text
jupyter notebook
Or upload .ipynb files to Google Colab.

About
Each notebook walks through fundamental unsupervised learning strategies from scratch.

Useful for students, beginners, or anyone interested in machine learning clustering algorithms.

Languages: Jupyter Notebook (Python)
